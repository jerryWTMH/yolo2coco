# yolo2coco
If you have run the yolov5 and your dataset is yolo-format, this file could help you create a coco-format json file.
The only thing you need to do is download the yolo2coco.py and change the text with '#####' in the file to match your dataset.

I used yolo2coco.py to get the json file and have successfully run the repositories like:

nanodet: https://github.com/RangiLyu/nanodet

CenterTrack: https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterTrack

EfficientDet: https://github.com/zylo117/Yet-Another-EfficientDet-Pytorch
